Hi! Im Leo Zorzoli and this is my web application for the Final Project of CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

I did the CS50 courses with the idea of ​​becoming a Web Developer in the future. 
That is why I wanted to make a representation of a website that I would do as a web developer in a supposed job.

This is a newspaper website where the owner and moderators can upload news and blogs and then show them to the users.

I use HTML and CSS to display the application templates, Python and Django to display the application, and a little of Javascript to create a dropdown and interactive menu.

When we create a news it is automatically displayed on the main page with a link to the news page. The same thing happens when we create a Blog. 
From the main screen we can access to the main and secondary news. Through a drop-down menu we can access all the news categories and from this menu we can search for any news.
The application also takes data from a weather API and another from Covid-19 and displays it on the main page. Also from it we can go to the contact tab and send a message that is saved in the database.
To reduce loading times, I added a paginator to the section of each category and another to the section of all news and all blogs.

The page is responsive for mobiles, ipads and for different types of monitors.

I tried to compile some of the activities done during the course in this last project and make them as tedious as I can, that's why I think this web application is more complex than the ones we did during the course.
